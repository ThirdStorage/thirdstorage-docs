# What is Third Storage

Third Storage is a collection of new age storage and identity paradigms to build web3 dapps. With Third Storage, developers can build unstoppable web3 dapps that value
the self-soverignity and privacy of user data. The development experience is similar to that of web2 but there are some breaking changes in infra.

We've integrated a number of traditional web2 databases along with web3 storage technologies like IPFS, Filecoin, Arweave etc., Developers can choose the storage paradigm
of their choice and get their hands dirty without manually having to make configurations.

Third Storage is currently 'self-hostable only' but we are working on shipping 'Third Storage Cloud' which uses distributed cloud deployments that are geo-redundant and
scalable with least downtime.
