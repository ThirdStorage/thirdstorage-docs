# Why Third Storage

Developers usually face the following problems in web2 and web3 databases repectively,


|                          | **Web2 Databases** | **Web3 Databases** |
|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Data sovereignty and ownership**     |                    |        ✅          |
| **Access control**       |       ✅           |                    |
| **Scalability**          |       ✅           |                    |
| **Speed and perfomance** |       ✅           |                    |
| **Costs**                |       ✅           |  Cheaper than Web2 (Filecoin and IPFS)                |
| **Data composability** |                  | Still in early stages                   |




Third Storage solves all the above highlighted problems by providing mutant databases that leverage the pros from both web2 and web3 databases in the following ways :

**Data soverignity :**
All the user data is self soverign and hosted on Filecoin. The data can not be tampered by external sources. The user has the governing power over his data whereas web2 data governance is external. 

**Access control :**
Decentralized access control is faciliated by using cryptography and lit protocol. Third Storage divides the user data into public and private based on the preference of user and developer.

**Scalablity :**
Third Storage can be scaled horizontally and vertically based on the preference of the developer. The infrastructure can be deployed into distributed and geo-redundant infra with minimal costs.

**Speed and perfomance :**
Third Storage does not compromise speed and perfomance in the name of 'decentralization'. We use caching mechanisms to make sure data retrival and writing is as fast as possible.

**Costs :**
A big misconception about web3 is 'Storage is very expensive'. But surprisingly, storage on Filecoin and other web3 native solutions are cheaper than centralized web2 solutions. Third Storage also facilitates 'perpetual file storage'.

### Data composability

Data composability is one of the crucial elements that was missing in web2. For example, if you hosted a file in AWS - it is not possible for **content addressing** it on another storage provider. 

Revolutionary technologies like IPFS can enable content addressing and data composability in web3. Third Storage leverages this capability to enable data composability between different [storage paradigms](getting-started/storage-paradigms.md). For example, if you wish to migrate from one storage paradigm to another in the future, you can do it without much hassle.

### Decentralized hosting

You can seamlessly host your dapps on web3 native hosting options with Third Storage. Decentralized hosting only available in [Third Storage Cloud](https://thirdstorage.com/cloud). We provide multiple cloud deployment options which include :
- IPFS Hosting : Hosting static web content on Filecoin and serving over IPFS.
- Cloud Hosting : Third Storage also facilitates Cloud hosting for dynamic dapps. You can opt to host using our native cloud hosting solution or alternatively use third-party providers.


### Multi-node scaling

With multi-node scaling you can boost data redundancy, data availability, vertical and horizontal scaling and level of decentralization. Multi-node scaling is only available for [Third Storage Cloud](https://thirdstorage.com/cloud) users.
