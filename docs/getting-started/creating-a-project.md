The first step of getting started with Third Storage is to create a new project.

### Create a Localhost project

If you are looking to create a new [Third Storage Localhost](https://thirdstorage.com/localhost) project, just enter the following command on your terminal :

```
npx thirdstorage
```

Once you run the above command, you will be required to select the [storage paradigm](/getting-started/storage-paradigms) of your choice. Currently, only **'demo paradigm'** is available in beta. You will be getting to know more about storage paradigms in the [next step](/getting-started/storage-paradigms).


### Create a Cloud project

[Third Storage Cloud](https://thirdstorage.com/cloud) is batteries ready - meaning that all the project setup and hosting is handled automatically. However, Cloud is not yet available for public usage. We are expecting to launch Third Storage Cloud in Q2 2023, stay tuned.
