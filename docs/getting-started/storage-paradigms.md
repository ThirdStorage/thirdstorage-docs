# Storage paradigms

Storage paradigms are pre-configured backends that have all the necessary authentication, database and storage setups required to build your application. There are multiple storage paradigms - **each paradigm differs from other in terms of technology, level of decentralization, scalability and perfomance needs**. Different use-cases might require different paradigms.

Though there are many differences in storage paradigms, they follow a **common standard for implementation and migration**. This makes Third Storage a highly compsable solution for building the future of web3 storage.

Third Storage is currently in beta. Only *'demo paradigm'* is available for public use as of now. We will be adding more storage paradigms in the near future. You can also [create your own storage paradigms](/advanced/creating-paradigms) using the technologies of your choice.
